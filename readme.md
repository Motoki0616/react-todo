# React To Do
This is a React To-do Application.
I watched [Andrew Mead](http://www.mead.io) tutorials and I made this application from scratch by myself.

* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* Babel
* React Router
* Express
* Axios
* Mocha

## Redux
Redux is an application data-flow architecture which maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree.
* There is always one source of truth, the store, with no confusion about how to sync the current state with actions and other parts of the application.
* Having a predictable outcome and strict structure makes the code easier to maintain.
* Redux is stricter about how code should be organized, which makes code more consistent and easier for a team to work with.

## Axios
Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* Allow performing transforms on data before request is made or after response is received
* Allow you to alter the request or response entirely. also perform async operations before request is made or before Promise settles
